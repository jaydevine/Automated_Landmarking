# **A Registration and Deep Learning Approach to Automated Landmark Detection for GM**

This repository contains Python/Bash scripts for atlas construction and pairwise volumetric image registration, Procrustes landmark coordinate data for training/testing, and Julia scripts to implement the DNN. 

## **Keywords**

Anatomical landmark, deep learning, geometry, image registration, micro-computed tomography, morphometrics.

## **Prerequisites**

1. Linux or macOS;
2. [Medical Imaging NetCDF (MINC) Toolkit](https://github.com/BIC-MNI/minc-toolkit-v2) with local and remote (compute cluster) installations. Note that MINC is a modality neutral imaging data format and associated set of tools and libraries developed at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) and freely available online. More information can be found at the [MINC Wikibooks page](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MINC);
3. Volumetric imaging data. Ideally the file sizes are 300 MB or less, but this is not a strict requirement;
4. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and associated packages;
5. [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/) and associated packages;
6. [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and associated packages.

## **Notes on Data**

The micro-computed tomography imaging data are not currently available due to ongoing projects. However, if you are interested in our adult mouse skull atlases and landmarks, please contact us here.
